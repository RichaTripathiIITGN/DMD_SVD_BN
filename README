Abstract:
The structure of complex networks underpins its functional attributes. The modular organization of networks, especially the empirical networks such as the 
brain networks is paramount to their functioning, as various designated brain areas cooperate together to perform a specific brain function. Hence, the 
understanding of the coincidence of the functional and structural communities in these networks is important. In this work we aim to analyze the overlap
between structural and functional communities in empirical brain networks. For structural communities, we employ the SVD technique and for functional 
communities identification, we use DMD technique. For dynamics on the brain networks, we use neural mass model of Wilson and Cowan. We find that.....
